Version 1.10

	* Fixed a bug where a case choice has a - in the name.  This
	wasn't being flagged as a case choice so it wasn't being padded.

Version 1.9

	* Fixed a bug where a subroutine with { on a separate line
	wasn't getting flagged as a subroutine so no spacing was
	getting added.

Version 1.8

	* Changed the copyright date to be 2018.

Version 1.7
	
	* Fixed a bug where a statement was being printed out for
	debug mode while not in debug mode.

Version 1.6

	* Created. (Leaving v1.6 in since that comes from SCCS.)
